EEE4022S - Undergraduate Project

## NewSensorApp

This is the Road Surface Data Collector application. This application was developed in order to collect various sensor information aquired from driving over a particular road surface. To run this application Android Studio is required to be installed. With Android Studio installed the project can be opened from the file section.

## PrototypeApplication

This is the Prototype Comfy Ride application developed which encorporate the data collection aspects in the Road Surface Data Collector application and provides the user with a visual and audio output about the road surface. The application provides the user with a report on the quality of a particular road surface and details to the user the smoothest parts of a particular road. To run this application Android Studio is required to be installed once this has been done the project can be opened.

## Plotting.py

This python file includes the Road Condition Algorithims that were implemented in order to detect certain road conditions. Python needs to be installed as well as the packages *numpy*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn* and *pandas*.

## Data Folders

The appropriately named data folders contains various data that was collected throughout the project. Unfortunately not all of the data is labelled and requires previous knowledge of the road surface to analyse in detail.
